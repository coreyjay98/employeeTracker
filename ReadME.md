## Project Description

This is a project that uses the command line in tandem with inquirer to interact dynamically with a mySQL Database. I have create a model employee database and have gave the user the ability to navigate the database and add specific information into it. This porject has endless possibilities due to the fact that with more time oe the project I could add many other features to interact with the database and make the displaying of the database even cleaner. I will look into making this better as time goes on and this project will be given further updates accordingly

### Installation

This app is ran through node and utilizes mySQL, to use you would need to install the NPM dependencies and then go on to create a mySQL schema with the information provided in the database.sql file, you would then have to connect the script to the database and would be able to use the application after that.

### Usage

Use of this application is simple as you are given prompts in the command line and can choose what you want to do yourself.

### Technologies Used

Javascript, Node.js, NPM, mySQL, inquirer, ckey
